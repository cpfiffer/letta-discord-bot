## üì¶ What's included

- [Letta TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-node)

  - The Letta TypeScript library provides convenient access to the Letta API.

- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)

  - Discord.js is a Node.js library that allows you to interact with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro), making it easy to build bot applications.

- [Express JS](https://expressjs.com)

  - Express JS is a minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js. We use Express to create a web server that accepts HTTP requests and interacts with the **Letta server** to generate responses. Express is also used to interact with the **Discord API**.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

  - TypeScript enhances our codebase with **static typing, improved maintainability, and better developer tooling**, reducing potential runtime errors.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

### üìã What you need before starting

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Discord App](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [LocalTunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel)

# üöÄ Running the app locally

> [!NOTE]
> These are instructions for running the *Discord bot server* locally, which connects a Letta server to Discord.
> If you're using Letta Cloud, all you'll need is your Letta Cloud API key + the Discord bot server, but if you're self-hosting, you'll also need to set up a Letta server.

## üíª Grab a Letta API key

Follow the [quickstart guide](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart) to get your own Letta Cloud API key.

You can run your own Letta server using [Letta Desktop](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart/desktop) or [Docker](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart/docker).
If you're self-hosting a server, the Letta server will run on `http://localhost:8283` by default (that will be your `LETTA_BASE_URL`).

## üëâ Set up app

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-discord-bot-example.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd letta-discord-bot-example

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables
cp .env.template .env
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Update the `.env` file with your Letta variables


## üëæ Create your Discord app and set your variables

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

<img width="475" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b57ec05b-5381-43f4-afc4-824a84abdd55" />


2Ô∏è‚É£ Under `Settings` -> `General Information` of your Discord app, copy your Discord application's `Application ID` and `Public Key`, and paste them in your `.env` file.

<img width="1302" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56e55a8e-6322-48a7-9b36-afbf538db359" />


3Ô∏è‚É£ Under `Settings` -> `Bot` of your Discord app, copy your Discord bot's `Token`, and paste it in your `.env` file.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Under `Settings` -> `Installation`, under `Guild Install` set up `scopes` and `permissions`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment variables

Environment variables can be controlled by setting them in your `.env` file or by setting them in your deployment environment.

The following environment variables can be set in the `.env` file:

* `LETTA_API_KEY`: The password of your Letta server (if you self-deployed a server). Not applicable if you are not using a password (see [docs](https://docs.letta.com/guides/server/docker#password-protection-advanced)).
* `LETTA_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your Letta server. Defaults to `https://api.letta.com` (Letta Cloud). If you're using a self-hosted Letta server, this is usually `http://localhost:8283`.
* `LETTA_AGENT_ID`: The ID of the Letta agent to use for the bot.
* `LETTA_CONTEXT_MESSAGE_COUNT`: Number of recent messages to include as conversation context (default: 5, set to 0 to disable).

* `APP_ID`: The ID of your Discord application.
* `DISCORD_TOKEN`: The bot token for your Discord bot.
* `PUBLIC_KEY`: The public key for your Discord bot.
* `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`: Set this if you want the bot to only listen to messages in a specific channel (ignores all other channels).
* `DISCORD_RESPONSE_CHANNEL_ID`: Set this if you want the bot to only respond in a specific channel (agent sees all messages but only replies here).

* `PORT`: The port to run the app on. Default is `3001`.

* `ENABLE_TIMER`: Enable or disable the timer feature (will randomly trigger an agent input/event at a certain interval, defaults to true). Note that the timer feature requires `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` to be set (so that the agent knows where to send a message to if the timer is fired).
* `TIMER_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Maximum interval range in minutes for the random timer (defaults to every 15 minutes).
* `FIRING_PROBABILITY`: Probability of the timer firing (0.0 to 1.0), defaults to 0.1 (10%).

* `MESSAGE_BATCH_ENABLED`: Enable message batching to accumulate multiple messages before sending to agent (default: false).
* `MESSAGE_BATCH_SIZE`: Maximum number of messages to batch before auto-draining (default: 10).
* `MESSAGE_BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS`: Milliseconds to wait before auto-draining batch (default: 30000 / 30 seconds).

For more settings (including options to enable/disable DM interactions, reply to non-directed messages, etc.), view the [`.env.template`](/.env.template) file provided.

### üëæ Create your Letta agent

You can connect an existing agent to Discord (by using its `LETTA_AGENT_ID`), or you can create a brand new agent specifically to use as a Discord bot.

If you create a new agent, we'd recommend adding some information (e.g. inside of the `human` or `persona` memory block) that explains how to interact with Discord. For example, placing the following text in `human`:
```
I can use this space in my core memory to take notes on the users that I am interacting with.
So far, all I know that is that I am connected to a Discord server.
I can see messages that other users send on this server, as long as they are directed at me (with a mention or a reply).
I should also remember that if I want to "at" a user, I need to use the <@discord-id> format in my message response.
This will render the user tag in a dynamic way on Discord, vs any other reference to a user (eg their username) will just result in plaintext.
```

Additionally, if you would like to give your chatbot/agent the ability to "ignore" (not reply) to certain messages, you can add a custom tool like this to your agent (for information on how to add a custom tool, see [our docs](https://docs.letta.com/guides/agents/tools#custom-tools)):
```python
def ignore():
    """
    Not every message warrants a reply (especially if the message isn't directed at you). Call this tool to ignore the message.
    """
    return
```

The ability for an agent to "ignore" messages can be crucial if you connect your agent to an active Discord channel with many participants, especially if you set `RESPOND_TO_GENERIC` to `true` (in which case the agent will "see" every single message in a channel, even messages not directed at the agent itself).

## üöÄ Run app

To run the app locally, simply do:
```bash
npm start
```

This will spin up the Discord bot service, which will listen for events on Discord, and when an event happens (e.g. a message is sent in a channel), it will send an appropriate message to the Letta server, check for a response from the Letta server, and potentially send back a reply message on Discord.

We have also prepared a one-click deploy option to easily deploy this repo on Railway.
Simply click the deploy link, enter your environment variables (including your Letta server address and Letta agent ID), and your Discord bot will be ready to go (and live 24/7):
